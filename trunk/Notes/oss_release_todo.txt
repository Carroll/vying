OSS Release Todo
----------------

  o  Move all serialization code to vortex, removing dependency on json gem

  o  Add rdoc comments to source files

  o  Add LICENSE file and copyright notices to all files

  o  Refactor Bots / Bot api

  o  Go through bin/ directory, reduce apps to bin/vying ???

  o  Review tests, add missing unit tests

  o  Add regression tests (download some GameResults from Vying Games, add
     test that replays and checks the checksums)

  o  Add ruby versions of C methods.  They'll be slower, but that way the
     vying gem will work on systems that don't have a unix-like build system

  o  Add Vying Games client that allows bots to connect and play games vs
     humans or other bots
