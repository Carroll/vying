This file describes the current status of all the games included here or
planned to be added.



=== Amazons (complete)

Could probably use more unit testing, and the bots could use some refinement.
But, it appears to be complete and correct.

=== Ataxx (complete)

Could probably use more unit testing, but it's very well tested (through
play), and correct.

=== Breakthrough (complete)

The rules are complete and correct.  The AI could use a lot of work.

=== Checkers (complete)

The rules for American Checkers (aka English Draughts, aka Straight Checkers)
are complete and correct.  The AI could use opening / closing books.

=== Connect4 (complete?)

Should probably just be removed.  This game doesn't offer much in terms of
game play due to first player bias.

=== Connect6 (complete)

The rules are complete and correct.

=== Keryo-Pente (complete)

The rules are complete and correct.

=== Pente (complete)

The rules are complete and correct.

=== TicTacToe (complete)

The rules are complete and correct.  The code should be reviewed and then used
as the test rules in some unit tests.

=== Kalah (complete)

The rules are complete and correct.  There is strong first player bias.  This
game should be "dropped" (hard to do because it's already been released), or a
fair variation should replace it.

=== Oware (complete)

The rules are complete and correct.

=== NineMensMorris (incomplete)

The rules are very close to complete and correct.  There is some question
about how to handle infinite cycles.  Should the players negotiate a draw?  Or,
should the rules force cycles to be called draws?  If the former the rules are
already done.

=== Hearts (incomplete)

The rules appear to be complete and correct.  Further testing needs to be
done, and the code should be reviewed and refactored.  The ideal situation
would be to add another trick-taking card game and then refactor Hearts and
the new game.

=== Pig (complete)

Simple game with random elements.  The rules should be complete and correct,
but may need to be refactored as more serious games with random elements are
added.

=== Footsteps (complete)

The rules are complete and correct.

=== Frames (incomplete)

Very basic implementation, it's unknown whether it's remotely correct.  Needs
much more unit testing.
