= Vying

Vying is a library for multi-player, turn-based, strategy games. The goal is to
make it easy to implement a large number of games very quickly, with only a
small amount of code. This includes the rules (or game logic) and AI, but does
not extend to user interface code (though there is a small, primitive
command-line program for playing games). This library is the core of Vying
Games <http://vying.org>.

Some of vying's features are:

  * Support for a wide range of game elements
    * Games with random starting positions
    * Games with random events (dice rolls, for example)
    * While turn-based, games may feature simultaneous turns (or sealed moves) 
  * Includes support for board games and card games (though the card game
    support is a little primitive still)
  * Most "rules" can be implemented approximately 100 lines of Ruby code
  * Fairly simple bot interface can make AI programming fairly simple (this
    needs improvement) 


== Development Info

This README is just a brief introduction to this library.  For more detailed /
up-to-date info see the dev wiki: <http://vying.org/dev/public/wiki/vying>.


== The Games

See doc/games.txt[link:files/doc/games_txt.html] for a list of games that have 
already been implemented.  There's a list of planned games on the development
wiki <http://vying.org/dev/public/wiki/PlannedGames>.


== Installation

Vying is available as a gem:

  gem install vying --source http://vying.org

Or, if you'd rather check the code out from subversion:

  svn co svn://code.vying.org/vying/trunk vying


== Command-Line Interface

This package includes a small command-line application called 'vying' that can
be invoked in the following ways.  To get more help on any of these commands
type:

  vying --help

=== To play a game:

  vying play --rules Breakthrough --player white=Human --player black=RandomBot

=== To benchmark a game:

  vying bench --rules Breakthrough

=== To check the branching factor of a game:

  vying branch --rules Breakthrough

=== To get info about a game:

  vying info --rules Breakthrough


== The Future

It's the goal of this library to document games through implementation.
Towards that end adding games, and making it easier to add games is this
library's top priority.  Secondarily, providing AI utility code, and bots that
play the games is also important.  Lastly, it's the goal of this library to
provide some kind of client connectivity to the Vying Games server.
